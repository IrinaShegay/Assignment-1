                <br><h3>5. Quokka.</h3><br>
                The <em>quokka</em>, also known as the short-tailed scrub wallaby , is a small macropod about the size of a domestic cat. It is the only member of the genus Setonix. Like other marsupials in the macropod family, the <em>quokka</em> is herbivorous and mainly nocturnal.
                <em>Quokkas</em> are found on some smaller islands off the coast of Western Australia, particularly Rottnest Island just off Perth and Bald Island near Albany. Isolated, scattered populations also exist in forest and coastal heath between Perth and Albany.

            <br><h3>4. Hedgehog.</h3><br>
            A <em>hedgehog</em> is a spiny mammal of the subfamily Erinaceinae, in the eulipotyphlan family Erinaceidae.  Like many of the first mammals, they have adapted to a nocturnal way of life. Their spiny protection resembles that of porcupines, which are rodents, and echidnas, a type of monotreme.

Its coat, ears, and kidney functions have adapted to the desert environment with high temperatures and little water.
